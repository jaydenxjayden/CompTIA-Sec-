<h1>CompTIA-Sec-</h1>

<h2>After completing the Google Cybersecurity Cert, I decided to study and take the exam for the CompTIA Sec+ Cert to learn more about Cybersecurity. (and also completing google cert came with 30% discount) ðŸ˜† <br>
Studying for the cert really feels to me more like learning all the common acronyms used in the industry. I used resources such as youtube tutorial videos, free practice exam questions, and google! I spent a total of around 2 weeks studying for this cert and passed with a score of 790/900. Super happy when I passed!(cost of certs are scary ðŸ˜¨) </h2>
